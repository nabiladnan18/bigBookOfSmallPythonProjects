# Readme

This project started off because there was no internet and I had a book called **The Big Book of Small Python Projects** written by **Al Sweigart**.

Trying to solve stuff without Googling stuff is really painful, especially when you realise that even the generate .gitignore command in Code requires the internet. JFC.
